# whichCat.js
This is a Tensorflow project to create a model that recognizes my cats. I had originally trained a model manually with Keras in Python but found that the Google Teachable Machine model was quick to make and better at classifying. 

Originally this was going to be a webapp using Tensorflow.js but I figured out how to make an iOS App that uses the model so that's on here instead.

Opening up the site will allow the user to use their webcam to classify an image. The only recognized objects are my cats, though, so it's not terribly useful to others. 

I plan to use this model and see what else I can do with Tensorflow.js and I'll use other repos if the model strays from my cats.
